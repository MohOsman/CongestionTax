### Project Assignment Questions and Solutions

These are some questions that came up during the assignment, but I worked around them using my hypothesis.

##### Question 1

In the assignment, I assumed that the given dates are input values, but there is no car type or something that identifies a vehicle. So, I added a registration number to differentiate between vehicles. I hope that I guessed right.

#####  Question 2

In the bonus part, it says to use an outside datastore. I used an H2 database, although it is an in-memory database, it acts as an "outside datasource" from the application. Does it Qualify for an outside datastore ?
